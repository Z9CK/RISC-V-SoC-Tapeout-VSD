# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)

Welcome to my learning repository for the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** by VSD.

This repo is a simple week-by-week record of my progress, notes, and tasks.  
The goal is to move step by step from **RTL → Synthesis → Physical Design → Tapeout** using open-source tools.

---

## 📅 Weekly Progress

- **Week 0** → Environment setup & tools installation
- **Week 1** → RTL design basics (coming soon)
- **Week 2** → Logic synthesis and verification (upcoming)
- More weeks will follow...

---

## Program Overview

- **Learning Path**: RTL → Synthesis → Physical Design → Tapeout  
- **Tools**: Yosys, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Magic VLSI, OpenLane  
- **Collaboration**: Part of India's RISC-V tapeout initiative  
- **Impact**: Learning by doing, with real-world semiconductor flows
